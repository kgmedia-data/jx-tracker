## pgwidth
- for HB it is fed in and maxwidth not defined so maxwidth set to pgwidth 
    - and = size of the slot
- for OSM - A very paragraph oriented thing
    - it is detected and already used in the adrequest
    - and it is also used in the rendering then
    - if maxwidth not set then maxwidth = pgwidth
- for the new universal, I think
    - they usually have the maxwidth
    - we try to detect pgwidth, if > maxwidth, then both set to ...?
    - ask Fery lah

## what kind of scaling is allowed for HB adserving size targeting algo?

## maxwidth
