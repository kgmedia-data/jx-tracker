## osmengine/core 

* module.exports:
  - createInstance (function(options, arrayOfPartnerObjects)
    - creates an OSM object from the params
    - As this is not meant to be controlled, this object has no APIs to be called
    - It is just "unleashed" and will take care of itself.

* requires/dependencies:
  - none (nothing direct - the arrayOfPartner objects is passed to us from the bundles
    layer)
