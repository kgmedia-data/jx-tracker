# README #

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Quick summary
- changed a lot of our frontend scripts (not including jixietracker) to be COMPONENTIZED.
- i.e. try not to have repeated code
- So each 'thing' is an assembly of some basic services and some more code
- At the top of the food chain are the stuff in the bundles/ directory (Or the "apps) :
    - Each one will get built into one of our core script offerings
        - hb renderer
        - osm (classic) - currently it loads ulite dyn. will change to "include" it
        - osm (amp)
        - univ lite 
        - univ full (means can play all kinds of stuff including the old players e.g. DM, YT, etc)
        - jixie video SDK
